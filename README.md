Snap game

Snap game built using PHP

I got a little further than the code you are seeing but was getting a few bugs and it would have taken longer to fix and re write than I had time for

Things that need adding or I would have added:

Only works for 2 players currently, to resolve this I would have to do something with the for loop that creates each players hands to account for odd player numbers where 52 wouldn't divide equally so players would have different numbers of cards

Last thing I was working on was allowing players to pick up their winning cards and for the round to start again. To do this I was going to use a while loop checking each players current card deck and see if they had cards in them, whilst they did the game would restart until someone won and then the "Played cards" would be added to the winning players pile.
Had a few issues with this and needed to use array_shift again but run out of time and I would like to get this sent over to you

Hope it reads well
